    "Combined multiple recursive random number generator
     This is a combined multiple recursive generator by L'Ecuyer. 
     Its sequence is z_n = (x_n - y_n) mod m_1
     where the two underlying generators x_n and y_n are,
     x_n = (a_1 x_{n-1} + a_2 x_{n-2} + a_3 x_{n-3}) mod m_1

     and moduli 
     m_1 = 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 and m_2 = 2145483479.
     The period of this generator is 2^205 (about 10^61).  It uses
     6 words of state per generator.  For more information see,

    "Four-tap Generalized Feedback Shift Register
    The *gfsr4* generator is like a lagged-Fibonacci generator, and 
    produces each number as an xor'd sum of four previous values.
    r_n = r_{n-A} \oplus r_{n-B} \oplus r_{n-C} \oplus r_{n-D}
    Ziff (ref below) notes that ``it is now widely known'' that two-tap
    registers (such as R250, which is described below)
    have serious flaws, the most obvious one being the three-point
    correlation that comes from the definition of the generator.  Nice
    mathematical properties can be derived for GFSR's, and numerics bears
    out the claim that 4-tap GFSR's with appropriately chosen offsets are as
    random as can be measured, using the author's test.

    This implementation uses the values suggested the example on p392 of
    Ziff's article: A=471, B=1586, C=6988, D=9689.

    If the offsets are appropriately chosen (such as the one ones in this
    implementation), then the sequence is said to be maximal; that means
    that the period is 2^D - 1, where D is the longest lag.
    (It is one less than 2^D because it is not permitted to have all
    zeros in the ra array.)  For this implementation with
    D=9689 that works out to about 10^2917.

    Note that the implementation of this generator using a 32-bit
    integer amounts to 32 parallel implementations of one-bit
    generators.  One consequence of this is that the period of this
    32-bit generator is the same as for the one-bit generator.
    Moreover, this independence means that all 32-bit patterns are
    equally likely, and in particular that 0 is an allowed random
    value.  (We are grateful to Heiko Bauke for clarifying for us these
    properties of GFSR random number generators.)
