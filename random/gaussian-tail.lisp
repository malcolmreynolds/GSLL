  "Random variates from the upper tail of a Gaussian
   distribution with standard deviation sigma.  The values returned
   are larger than the lower limit a, which must be positive.  The
   method is based on Marsaglia's famous rectangle-wedge-tail algorithm (Ann. 
   Math. Stat. 32, 894--899 (1961)), with this aspect explained in Knuth, v2,
   3rd ed, p139,586 (exercise 11).
   The probability distribution for Gaussian tail random variates is,
   p(x) dx = {1 \over N(a;\sigma) \sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}}
                  \exp (- x^2 / 2\sigma^2) dx
   for x > a where N(a;\sigma) is the normalization constant,
   N(a;\sigma) = (1/2) erfc(a / sqrt(2 sigma^2)).")
