     <h1>Comparison of floating point numbers in Common Lisp</h1>
   </div>

   <p>
   Floating point numbers are a computer representation of the real
   numbers.  Unlike the real numbers, there are a finite
   number of them.  So there is a smallest and largest floating point
   number, and all others have a predecessor and successor.
   <p>
   Because different compilers and platforms can reorder a calculation
   and optimize in a way that is approximated differently and so do
   not necessarily produce the same floating point number, it is
   difficult to compare two floating point numbers and conclude that
   they represent the same result.  For the purposes of regression (or
   unit) testing, we would like to do exactly this.  Bruce Dawson
   addressed this problem in "<a
   href="http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm">Comparing
   Floating Point Numbers</a>."  He makes the point that the best way
   to do this correctly is to interpret each floating point number as
   an integer.  By taking advantage of the <a
   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating-point_standard">IEEE
   754</a> standard for representation of floating point numbers, we
   can construct a function that maps the floating point numbers to
   the integers.  The genius of the standard's inventor <a
   href="http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/">W. Kahan</a> is that a
   mapping derived from the standard, call it i(x), satisfies three
   properties:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>If two floats a&lt;b, then i(a)&lt;i(b),
    <li>if two floats are adjacent and a&lt;b, then i(b)=i(a)+1,</li>
    <li>and finally i(0.0)=0.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
   Dawson provides some clever C constructs to read a floating point
   number as an integer, and instruction on how to prevent the
   compiler from complaining about your trickery in doing so.  Common
   Lisp instead provides us with
   functions with which we can properly construct our own integers.
   As a side benefit, we don't care what the <i>actual</i>
   representation of the floating point number is; we will build our
   own IEEE-like representation.  We don't exactly want the full
   IEEE754 word though; we leave off the most significant
   bit, which is a sign bit, and instead make the sign of the integer agree with the
   sign of the float.
   <p>What we end up with is an <i>enumeration of the floats</i>.
   That is, for every single precision float, there is one integer in
   the range 
   [-2139095039, 2139095039], and vice versa, with the exception that
   both positive and negative zero (allowed by the standard) map to
   zero.  Likewise, there is a one-to-one mapping of the
    double precision floats to
   [-9218868437227405311,9218868437227405311].  Floats with
   special values (positive and negative infinity, and <a
   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN">NaN</a>) that are required
   by the standard do not have integer values.
   <p>
   The following functions written in Common Lisp are given:
   </p>
   <ul>
   <li><code>float-as-integer</code> which is the function i(x);</li>
   <li><code>integer-as-float</code> which is the inverse function
   (this isn't necessary but can be useful) and
   also returns the rational form of the float;</li>
   <li><code>decode-IEEE754</code> (used by other functions) that
   returns five values: 
   significand, exponent, sign, bits in significand, bits in
   exponent, all as integers;</li>
   <li><code>format-IEEE754-bits</code> which prints out the
   binary form of the IEEE word, separated into the three parts
   (this isn't necessary but is nice for comparing with bit
   expansions shown in references like the Wikipedia page).</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
  Here are some interesting floats:
   <pre>
(float-as-integer most-negative-single-float)
-2139095039
(float-as-integer least-negative-single-float)
-1
(float-as-integer -0.0f0)
0
(float-as-integer 0.0f0)
0
(float-as-integer least-positive-single-float)
1
(float-as-integer (- 1.0f0 single-float-negative-epsilon))
1065353215
(float-as-integer 1.0f0)
1065353216
(float-as-integer (+ 1.0f0 single-float-epsilon))
1065353217
(float-as-integer most-positive-single-float)
2139095039
</pre>
   <p>
   A regression test would record not the floating point number, but
   the integer produced by <code>float-as-integer</code>.  Since
   integers can be unambiguously formatted to and read from a text
   file in a unique way, a subsequent recomputation would provide a
   clear indication of how close the floats are.  Of course, we must
   decide how much error we're going to allow, because a correct
   calculation may produce slightly different integers.  As an added
   bonus, these functions can be used to identify (in languages other
   than Lisp) when a positive single float has been interpreted as a
   double float.
   <p>
   The floating point numbers computed for the regression tests here
   were done with IEEE 754 double precision compatibility.  If these
   tests are run on a platform that does not follow this standard, the
   tests may fail.
