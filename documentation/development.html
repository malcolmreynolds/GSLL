 <h3>Goals</h3>
  <p>The goal of this project is to provide as complete an interface
  to the GSL as possible in as Lisp-natural a way as is reasonable.  It is
  written only in Common Lisp (no C), with access to the foreign library
  through CFFI.

 <h3>Non-goals</h3>
 The following is not part of the plan for the GSLL interface:
  <ul>
  <li>Anything that is defined solely in C header files and not in the .so
  library will not be a part of GSLL, because of the lack of access
  through the library.  For example, Physical Constants
  are all defined as C macros.</li>
  <li>Anything for which there are two near-equivalent GSL functions
  and for which one is already provided.  For example, all of the
  special functions have two forms, one which provides the answer(s)
  with an estimated error as a structure, and one which just provides
  the answer as a double.  This makes a
  difference when C programming, but GSLL always uses the form with the
  error estimate and returns the error as a later multiple value so
  that it can easily be ignored.</li>
  <li>Anything for which there is a Common Lisp
  equivalent probably won't be done, unless there is a need to have it
  present for some other GSL functionality that isn't present in CL.
  </li>
  </ul>

 <h3>Status</h3>
  <div class="content">
  <p>There is a <a href="http://trac.common-lisp.net/gsll">Trac page</a> 
  for development information and for reporting bugs.  There is a <a
  href="http://common-lisp.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/gsll-devel">mailing
  list</a> for all aspects of this project.
  </p> 

  <p>Most of the interface is complete, with a few chapters missing
  and some functionality missing.  See the <a
  href="documentation.html">documentation</a> for details,
  particularly known failures.
  It is possible that the library API will change but probably not
   substantially; most of the remaining work is to fix bugs.

 <h3>Contributions</h3>
 Contributions to the development of GSLL are welcome; the primary
 way to get started is by posting to the
 <a href="http://common-lisp.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/gsll-devel">mailing
  list</a>; also see
  the <a href="http://trac.common-lisp.net/gsll">Trac page</a>.  A
  contribution may take the form of bug reports and fixes, suggestions
  for new interface design, porting the remaining unported
  functions, testing on a new platform or compiler.  The supplied macros
   <code>defmfun</code> and <code>defmpar</code>
   define virtually all of the interface functions and variables
   respectively, which simplifies the process of porting. 
   The arguments and defaults provide a convenient way of defining new
   functions and variables.

<h3>Regression tests</h3>
  <div class="content">
   <p>Regression tests using <a
   href="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/academics/courses/325/readings/lisp-unit.html">lisp-unit</a>
   (provided) are given for many of the functions defined.  These
   also serve as examples.  Note that most of the result have not been verified
   with an independent source; the values given are from previous
   tests.  To run the tests,
<pre>
(lisp-unit:run-tests)
</pre>
See <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a> regarding known failures.
