  <h2>GSLL Development</h2>
 </div>

 <h3>Goals</h3>
  <p>The goal of this project is to provide as complete an interface
  to the GSL as possible in as Lisp-natural a way as is reasonable.  It is
  written only in Common Lisp (no C), with access to the foreign library
  through CFFI.

 <h3>Non-goals</h3>
 The following is not part of the plan for the GSLL interface:
  <ul>
  <li>Anything that is defined solely in C header files and not in the .so
  library will not be a part of GSLL, because of the lack of access
  through the library.  For example, Chapter 38, Physical Constants,
  are all defined as C macros.</li>
  <li>Anything for which there are two near-equivalent GSL functions
  and for which one is already provided.  For example, all of the
  special functions have two forms, one which provides the answer(s)
  with an estimated error as a structure, and one which just provides
  the answer as a double.  This makes a
  difference when C programming, but GSLL always uses the form with the
  error estimate and returns the error as a later multiple value so
  that it can easily be ignored.</li>
  <li>Anything for which there is a Common Lisp
  equivalent probably won't be done, unless there is a need to have it
  present for some other GSL functionality that isn't present in CL.
  </li>
  <li>Data types that are not defined in Common Lisp portably (such as
 uint) may not be well supported.  Others may be added but it
 may be difficult to do so in a portable way.  There are several
 macros that should make this relatively easy.
 </li>
  </ul>

 <h3>Status</h3>
  <div class="content">
  Development of GSLL will be tracked using Trac, to be set up.

  <p>Most of the interface is complete, with a few chapters missing
  and some functionality missing.  See the <a
  href="documentation.html">documentation</a> for details.
  It is possible that the library API will change but probably not
   substantially; most of the remaining work involves added functions.

   Although many of the file output functions have been ported, none
   have been tested, and they likely will need additional C or support
   from other libraries.

   <p>
   There seem to be differences in the random number generators
   between amd64 and i386, so many regression tests fail as the
   sequences are not the same.

   <p>
  In addition to the chapters below, it would be nice if the following
  were done<ul>
  <li>Native vectors like <code>sb-sys:vector-sap</code> in SBCL.
  </ul>


 <h3>Contributions</h3>
 Contributions to the development of GSLL are welcome.
 This make take the form of bug reports and fixes, suggestions for new
 interface design, or of porting the remaining unported functions.
   The supplied macros
   <code>defmfun</code> and <code>defmpar</code>
   define virtually all of the interface functions and variables
   respectively, which simplifies the process of porting. 
   The arguments and defaults provide a convenient way of defining new
   functions and variables.

   <p>Where functions in the GSL library
   do input and output to files, the remainder of the necessary
   file-related operations must also be performed in C; no CL
   interface is yet provided.</p>
  <p>A Trac web page will soon be set up for those interested in
  development, and for reporting bugs.  In the meantime, send email to
  me at this address: <code>lhealy</code> -at-
  <code>common-lisp</code> -dot- <code>net</code>.</p>

<h3>Regression tests</h3>
  <div class="content">
   <p>Regression tests using <a
   href="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/academics/courses/325/readings/lisp-unit.html">lisp-unit</a>
   (provided) are given for many of the functions defined.  These
   also serve as examples.  Note that most of the result have not been verified
   with an independent source; the values given are from previous
   tests.  To run the tests,
<pre>
(lisp-unit:run-tests)
</pre>
See <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a> regarding known failures.
