      <p>The GNU Scientific Library for Lisp (GSLL) allows you to use
      the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU Scientific
      Library (GSL)</a> from Common Lisp.  This library provides a
      full range of common mathematical operations useful to
      scientific and engineering applications.  The design of the GSLL
      interface is such that access to most of the GSL library is
      possible in a Lisp-natural way; the intent is that the user not
      be hampered by the restrictions of the C language in which GSL
      has been written.  GSLL thus provides interactive use of GSL for
      getting quick answers, even for someone not intending
      to program in Lisp.
