 <h3>General Advice</h3>
 <div class="content">

 <p>There is little separate documentation for GSLL.  Instead, the
 following techniques for using the API are advised:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Find the appropriate function(s) in the <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/">GSL
 documentation</a>.</li>
 <li>Use the GSLL function <code>gsl-lookup</code>
  to find the equivalent GSLL function, for example
<pre>
(gsl-lookup "gsl_sf_elljac_e")
JACOBIAN-ELLIPTIC-FUNCTIONS
T
</pre>
to find that the Lisp function name is <code>#'jacobian-elliptic-functions</code>.  
  </li>
 <li>Look at the documentation for that Lisp function, e.g.
   <pre>(documentation #'jacobian-elliptic-functions 'function)
"The Jacobian elliptic functions sn(u|m),
  cn(u|m), dn(u|m) computed by descending Landen transformations."
   </pre>
   to get an explanation of the arguments etc.
 </li>
 <li>Look at the end of the Lisp source file, or in an "example" file
 in the same directory, for examples.  Often, the examples are placed
 in a <code>make-tests</code> form (which will be commented out with
 a #| |# block).  If the 
 <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/">GSL documentation</a>
 provides an example, there will usually be the same or similar
 example provided in GSLL.</li>
 </ul>
 It is advisable to look at the examples first for calculations that
 require more complex setup (generally, the later chapters in the GSL
 manual).

 <h3>GSL objects and letm </h3>
There are a number of GSL structures available that must be manually
allocated, possibly set, and freed.  In
order to make this as convenient as possible, the macro
<code>letm</code> is provided.  This macro acts as a
<code><a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/s_let_l.htm#letST">let*</a></code>,
with the additional feature that if the init-form is one of GSL objects

<pre>
acceleration basis-spline block-complex block-double-float block-fixnum
block-single-float chebyshev combination complex-workspace
discrete-random eigen-herm eigen-hermv eigen-symm eigen-symmv
fdfsolver fit-workspace fminimizer fsolver hankel histogram
integration-workspace interpolation levin levin-truncated
matrix-complex matrix-double-float matrix-fixnum
matrix-single-float mfdfminimizer mfdfsolver mfminimizer mfsolver
monte-carlo-miser monte-carlo-plain monte-carlo-vegas
nonlinear-fdffit nonlinear-ffit permutation
quasi-random-number-generator random-number-generator spline
vector-complex vector-double-float vector-fixnum
vector-single-float wavelet wavelet-workspace
</pre>
the appropriate object will be allocated and bound to the variable,
optionally set, and then freed when the body of the let is exited.
For Lisp environments with arglist prompting (such as SLIME), these
are functions whose symbols are exported so that an arglist prompt
will be visible; however, the function should not be used outside a
let binding.

 <h3>Data: vectors, matrices, etc.</h3>
 <div class="content">
 <p>
 Collectively, vectors, matrices, histograms and the like are called
 <i>data</i>.  There are many different types of vectors and matrices
 supported by GSL, but GSLL has implemented only a few of these:
 complex, double-float, single-float, and fixnum, because those types
 are defined by the Common Lisp standard.
 <p>Vectors and matrices can be converted to and from their Lisp
 counterparts with <code>data</code> and <code>(setf data)</code>.
 Setting the GSL value to a Lisp value at initialization
 can be done within the <code>letm</code> by giving the Lisp value as
 the first argument after the type, for example
<pre>
(letm ((vec (vector-double-float #(-3.21d0 1.0d0 12.8d0))))
   (data vec))
</pre>
 Individual elements of data may be accessed with <code>maref</code>,
 either directly or in a <code>setf</code>.

 <h3>Status</h3>
 <div class="content">
 Consistent with the <a href="development.html">development</a>
 philosophy, most of the interface to the library is done.  Notes
 on particular chapters:
<ul>
<base href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/">
<li><a href="Vectors-and-Matrices.html">Vectors and Matrices</a>
	are done for integer, real, double, complex.
	 Subvectors and views don't work.  Other element types may be
        difficult to port due to lack of CL definition.
<li>Functions that provide file input and output to files are not tested and
 likely will need other definitions (perhaps in C) to function
 properly, unless CFFI and the CL platform provide C stream
 compatibility.
<li><a href="BLAS-Support.html">BLAS</a> is completed, but with only very
 limited testing.
 <li><a href="Fast-Fourier-Transforms.html">FFTs</a> have not been done
 because GSL does not supply an example and it is not clear how it is
 used.  Contributions welcome. 
<li><a href="Simulated-Annealing.html">Simulated Annealing</a> is
 known to have problems in GSL and a replacement <a
 href="https://gna.org/projects/annealing">is being redesigned</a>; 
 the version distributed has been ported in GSLL but does not work.
<li><a href="Wavelet-Transforms.html">Wavelet Transforms</a> has been
 done but the results of the example do not agree with the GSL manual.
<li><a href="Discrete-Hankel-Transforms.html">Discrete Hankel
 Transforms</a> has been done but there is no example given in the GSL
 manual. 
<li><a href="Basis-Splines.html">Basis splines</a> example runs, but
 the GSL documentation does not provide the result for comparison.
</ul>
<p>
There are failures observed in the regression tests
<code>(lisp-unit:run-tests)</code>:
<ul>
<li>CLISP shows three "foreign callout errors." Remedy unknown.
<li>There are several regression failures that are apparently due to
changes in GSL between versions 1.8 and 1.10.  These are:
beta, chi-squared, dirichlet, elliptic-functions, fdist,
gamma-randist, negative-binomial.
</ul>
