 <h3>General Advice</h3>
 <div class="content">

 <p>There is little separate documentation for GSLL.  Instead, the
 following techniques for using the API are advised:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Find the appropriate function(s) in the <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/">GSL
 documentation</a>.</li>
 <li>Use the GSLL function <code>gsl-lookup</code>
  to find the equivalent GSLL function, for example
<pre>
(gsl-lookup "gsl_sf_elljac_e")
JACOBIAN-ELLIPTIC-FUNCTIONS
T
</pre>
to find that the Lisp function name is <code>#'jacobian-elliptic-functions</code>.  
  </li>
 <li>Look at the documentation for that Lisp function, e.g.
   <pre>(documentation #'jacobian-elliptic-functions 'function)
"The Jacobian elliptic functions sn(u|m),
  cn(u|m), dn(u|m) computed by descending Landen transformations."
   </pre>
   to get an explanation of the arguments etc.
 </li>
 <li>Look at the end of the Lisp source file, or in an "example" file
 in the same directory, for examples.  Often, the examples are placed
 in a <code>make-tests</code> form (which will be commented out with
 a #| |# block).</li>
 </ul>
 It is advisable to look at the examples first for calculations that
 require more complex setup (generally, the later chapters in the GSL
 manual) because often there are convenience macros defined to make
 the setup simpler.
 </div>

 <h3>GSL objects and letm </h3>
There are a number of GSL structures available that must be manually
allocated, possibly set, and freed.  In
order to make this as convenient as possible, the macro
<code>letm</code> is provided.  This macro acts as a
<code><a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/s_let_l.htm#letST">let*</a></code>,
with the additional feature that if the init-form is one of GSL objects

<pre>
acceleration basis-spline block-complex block-double block-fixnum
block-single chebyshev combination complex-workspace discrete-random
eigen-herm eigen-hermv eigen-symm eigen-symmv fdfsolver fit-workspace
fminimizer fsolver hankel histogram integration-workspace
interpolation levin levin-truncated matrix-complex matrix-double
matrix-fixnum matrix-single mfdfminimizer mfdfsolver mfminimizer
mfsolver monte-carlo-miser monte-carlo-plain monte-carlo-vegas
nonlinear-fdffit nonlinear-ffit permutation
quasi-random-number-generator random-number-generator spline
vector-complex vector-double vector-fixnum vector-single wavelet
wavelet-workspace
</pre>
the appropriate object will be allocated and bound to the variable,
optionally set, and then freed when the body of the let is exited.
For Lisp environments with arglist prompting (such as SLIME), these
are functions whose symbols are exported so that an arglist prompt
will be visible; however, the function should not be used outside a
let binding.

 <h3>Status</h3>
 <div class="content">
 Consistent with the <a href="development.html">development</a>
 philosophy, most of the interface to the library is done.  Notes
 particular chapters:
<ul>
<li><a href="Vectors-and-Matrices.html">Vectors and Matrices</a>
	are done for integer, real, double, complex.
	 Subvectors and views don't work.  Other element types may be
        difficult to port due to lack of CL definition.
	      <base href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/">
<li>Some <a href="Sorting.html">sorting</a> functions fail on amd64 platforms,
 perhaps because of lack of unsigned integer vectors.
<li><a href="BLAS-Support.html">BLAS</a> is completed, but with only very
 limited testing.
 <li><a href="Fast-Fourier-Transforms.html">FFTs</a> has not been done
 because GSL does not supply an example and it is not clear how it
 used.  Contributions welcome. 
<li><a href="Simulated-Annealing.html">Simulated Annealing</a> has
 been done but does not work.
<li><a href="Wavelet-Transforms.html">Wavelet Transforms</a> has been
 done but the results of the example do not agree with the GSL manual.
<li><a href="Discrete-Hankel-Transforms.html">Discrete Hankel
 Transforms</a> has been done but there is no example given in the GSL
 manual. 
<li><a href="Basis-Splines.html">Basis splines</a> have yet to be tested.
</ul>
