  ;; FDL
  "The bisection algorithm is the simplest method of bracketing the
   roots of a function.   It is the slowest algorithm provided by
   the library, with linear convergence.

   On each iteration, the interval is bisected and the value of the
   function at the midpoint is calculated.  The sign of this value is used
   to determine which half of the interval does not contain a root.  That
   half is discarded to give a new, smaller interval containing the
   root.  This procedure can be continued indefinitely until the interval is
   sufficiently small.

   At any time the current estimate of the root is taken as the midpoint of
   the interval.")

(defmpar *false-position-fsolver* "gsl_root_fsolver_falsepos"
  ;; FDL
  "The false position algorithm is a method of finding roots based on
   linear interpolation.  Its convergence is linear, but it is usually
   faster than bisection.

   On each iteration a line is drawn between the endpoints (a,f(a))
   and (b,f(b)) and the point where this line crosses the
   x-axis taken as a ``midpoint''.  The value of the function at
   this point is calculated and its sign is used to determine which side of
   the interval does not contain a root.  That side is discarded to give a
   new, smaller interval containing the root.  This procedure can be
   continued indefinitely until the interval is sufficiently small.

   The best estimate of the root is taken from the linear interpolation of
   the interval on the current iteration.")

(defmpar *brent-fsolver* "gsl_root_fsolver_brent"
  ;; FDL
  "The Brent-Dekker method (referred to here as Brent's method)
   combines an interpolation strategy with the bisection algorithm.  This
   produces a fast algorithm which is still robust.

   On each iteration Brent's method approximates the function using an
   interpolating curve.  On the first iteration this is a linear
   interpolation of the two endpoints.  For subsequent iterations the
   algorithm uses an inverse quadratic fit to the last three points, for
   higher accuracy.  The intercept of the interpolating curve with the
   x-axis is taken as a guess for the root.  If it lies within the
   bounds of the current interval then the interpolating point is accepted,
   and used to generate a smaller interval.  If the interpolating point is
   not accepted then the algorithm falls back to an ordinary bisection
   step.

   The best estimate of the root is taken from the most recent
   interpolation or bisection.")

(defmpar *newton-fdfsolver* "gsl_root_fdfsolver_newton"
  ;; FDL
  "Newton's Method is the standard root-polishing algorithm.  The algorithm
   begins with an initial guess for the location of the root.  On each
   iteration, a line tangent to the function f is drawn at that
   position.  The point where this line crosses the x-axis becomes
   the new guess.  The iteration is defined by the following sequence,
   x_{i+1} = x_i - f(x_i) / f'(x_i)
   Newton's method converges quadratically for single roots, and linearly
   for multiple roots.")

(defmpar *secant-fdfsolver* "gsl_root_fdfsolver_secant"
  ;; FDL
  "The secant method is a simplified version of Newton's method which does
   not require the computation of the derivative on every step.
   On its first iteration the algorithm begins with Newton's method, using
   the derivative to compute a first step,
   x_1 = x_0 - f(x_0)/f'(x_0)
   Subsequent iterations avoid the evaluation of the derivative by
   replacing it with a numerical estimate, the slope of the line through
   the previous two points,
   x_{i+1} = x_i - f(x_i) / f'_{est}
    where
   f'_{est} =  f(x_{i}) - f(x_{i-1}) / x_i - x_{i-1}
   When the derivative does not change significantly in the vicinity of the
   root the secant method gives a useful saving.  Asymptotically the secant
   method is faster than Newton's method whenever the cost of evaluating
   the derivative is more than 0.44 times the cost of evaluating the
   function itself.  As with all methods of computing a numerical
   derivative the estimate can suffer from cancellation errors if the
   separation of the points becomes too small.

   On single roots, the method has a convergence of order (1 + \sqrt
   5)/2 (approximately 1.62).  It converges linearly for multiple
   roots.")

(defmpar *steffenson-fdfsolver* "gsl_root_fdfsolver_steffenson"
  ;; FDL
  "The Steffenson method provides the fastest convergence of all the
   routines.  It combines the basic Newton algorithm with an Aitken
   ``delta-squared'' acceleration.  If the Newton iterates are x_i
   then the acceleration procedure generates a new sequence R_i,
   R_i = x_i - (x_{i+1} - x_i)^2 / (x_{i+2} - 2 x_{i+1} + x_i)
   which converges faster than the original sequence under reasonable
   conditions.  The new sequence requires three terms before it can produce
   its first value so the method returns accelerated values on the second
   and subsequent iterations.  On the first iteration it returns the
   ordinary Newton estimate.  The Newton iterate is also returned if the
   denominator of the acceleration term ever becomes zero.

   As with all acceleration procedures this method can become unstable if
   the function is not well-behaved.")
