Features:

- Designed so that usage of GSL is as if GSL were written in CL:
  information flow correctly through functions, full condition
  handling, all information returned is available.

- Conditions are handled in a Lisp-friendly way; full use of the CL
  condition system with full explanations.

- Uses CFFI.  Should work with any Common Lisp that supports CFFI with
  callbacks and foreign-funcall.

- This library is pure common lisp.  No C is used; the only requirement
is that the GSL library must be loaded and accessible.

- ??? No actual functions are defined, just the macros for gaining
access to the functions.  Defining the functions you need yourself is
very easy.
