  <h1>GSLL</h1>
  <h2>GNU Scientific Library for Lisp</h2>
 </div>

 <h3>Introduction</h3>
 <div class="content">
      <p>The GNU Scientific Library for Lisp (GSLL) allows you to use
      the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU Scientific
      Library (GSL)</a> from Common Lisp.  This library provides a
      full range of common mathematical operations useful to
      scientific and engineering applications.  The design of the GSLL
      interface is such that access to most of the GSL library is
      possible in a Lisp-natural way; the intent is that the user not
      be hampered by the restrictions of the C language in which GSL
      has been written.  GSLL thus provides interactive use of GSL for
      getting quick answers, even for someone not intending
      to program in Lisp.
      </p>
      <p>This code should be considered alpha but it is largely usable
      now, with some GSL capability not yet available. See
      Development section below.</p>
 <p>This software is distributed under the <a
	  href="http://www.cliki.net/GPL">GPL</a>
	  and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">FDL</a>.
	  ??? REally; can't find it in the source code.???
	  If the GSL docstrings are included, the ??? text ???? must
	  be included in any distribution, as required by the FDL.
	  The remainder of the source code is licensed under the GPL.

 <h3>Examples</h3>
 <div class="content">
 <p>The Jacobian elliptic functions <i>sn</i>, <i>cn</i>, and
 <i>dn</i> are special functions (Chapter 7):</p> 
<pre>
(jacobian-elliptic-functions 0.2d0 0.81d0)
0.19762082367187703d0
0.9802785369736752d0
0.9840560289645665d0
1.828927267118668d-318
1.4821969375237396d-321
2.023692885365746d-320
</pre>
      <p>which returns the three function values in succession, along
      with the estimated errors of each.  The functions are defined
      only if the second argument <i>m</i> is not greater than 1,
      so an error is signalled if this parameter is out of range: </p>
<pre>
(jacobian-elliptic-functions 0.61802d0 1.5d0)
debugger invoked on a GSL-ERROR in thread #<THREAD "initial thread" {10032258C1}>:
  Input domain error (EDOM), |m| > 1.0 in elljac.c at line 46
</pre>
 </div>
 
 <h3>Documentation</h3>
 <div class="content">

 <p>There is little separate documentation for GSLL.  Instead, the
 following techniques for using the API are advised:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Find the appropriate function(s) in the <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/">GSL
 documentation</a>.</li>
 <li>Use the GSLL function gsl-lookup
  to find the equivalent GSLL function, for example
<pre>
(gsl-lookup "gsl_sf_elljac_e")
((JACOBIAN-ELLIPTIC-FUNCTIONS . "gsl_sf_elljac_e"))
</pre>
to find that the Lisp function name is #'JACOBIAN-ELLIPTIC-FUNCTIONS.  
  </li>
 <li>Look at the documentation for that Lisp function, e.g.
   <pre>(documentation #'jacobian-elliptic-functions 'function)
  "The Jacobian elliptic functions @math{sn(u|m)},
  @math{cn(u|m)}, @math{dn(u|m)} computed by descending Landen
  transformations."
   </pre>
   to get an explanation of the arguments etc.
 </li>
 <li>Look at the end of the Lisp source file for examples.</li>
 </ul>
 </div>

 <h3>Requirements and Platforms</h3>
 <div class="content">
  <p> GSLL should work in
      any Common Lisp implementation and platform combination
      that has <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cffi/">CFFI</a>
       with callbacks and defcfun support.  You will need
      </p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GSL</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cffi/">CFFI</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cliki.net/asdf">ASDF</a>
	  </ul>
      <p>
	If you are running Debian, the following should work:</p>
      <blockquote><pre>apt-get install libgsl0 cl-cffi</pre></blockquote>
      (asdf is automatically installed with your CL implementation).
      <p>Once your CL implementation is running, do</p>
      <blockquote><pre>(asdf:operate 'asdf:compile-op :gsll)
      </pre></blockquote>
      <p>or, if using Debian with the common-lisp-controller,</p>
      <blockquote><pre>(clc:clc-require :gsll)</pre></blockquote>
  <p>GSLL has been tested with SBCL on Debian i386 and amd64.</p>

 <h3>Project Development</h3>
  <div class="content">
  <p>This project has been in development for a year.  A majority is
  done, but there is still much work to do.  The status is summarized
  below, by reference to the Chapters in the GSL manual.</p>
   <p>It is possible that the library API will change but probably not
   substantially; most of the remaining work involves added functions.
   GSLL is written in pure Common Lisp; there is no C "glue" layer.
   As such, most every function can be defined with the supplied macro
   <code>defun-gsl</code>, which simplifies the process of porting.
   The arguments and defaults provide a convenient way of defining new
   functions; it is likely this will not change as the rest of GSL
   functionality is added to GSLL.  Where functions in the GSL library
   do input and output to files, the remainder of the necessary
   file-related operations must also be performed in C; no CL
   interface is yet provided.</p>
   <p>Regression tests using <a
   href="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/academics/courses/325/readings/lisp-unit.html">lisp-unit</a>
   (provided) are given for many of the functions defined.  These
   also serve as examples.  The judgement of floating point numbers as
   equivalent is a hack, and needs to be replaced; I am looking for
   good ideas.  Note that most of the result have not been verified
   with an indpendent source; the values given are from previous
   tests.</p>
  <p>A Trac web page will soon be set up for those interested in
  development, and for reporting bugs.  In the meantime, send email to
  me at this address: <code>lhealy</code> -at-
  <code>common-lisp</code> -dot- <code>net</code>.</p> 
 <h4>Completed</h4>
  <div class="content">
   </div>
 <h4>In progress</h4>
  <div class="content">
  Work has been done on the following, but not to completion
   </div>
 <h4>To be done</h4>
  <div class="content">
  The following should eventually be done
  Native vectors
  </div>
 <h4>Won't be done</h4>
  <div class="content">
  <p>The following is not part of the plan for the GSLL interface:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Anything that is defined solely in C header files and not in the .so
  library will not be a part of GSLL, because of the lack of access
  through the library.  For example, Chapter 38, Physical Constants,
  are all defined as C macros.</li>
  <li>Anything for which there are two near-equivalent GSL functions
  and for which one is already provided.  For example, all of the
  special functions have two forms, one which provides the answer(s)
  with an estimated error as a structure, and one which just provides
  the answer as a double.  This makes a
  difference when C programming, but GSLL always uses the form with the
  error estimate and returns the error as a later multiple value so
  that it can easily be ignored.</li>
  <li>Anything for which there is a Common Lisp
  equivalent probably won't be done, unless there is a need to have it
  present for some other GSL functionality that isn't present in CL.
  </li>
  </ul>

  A partial automatically-generated interface to GSL is provided in <a

  A matlab-like array syntax and plotting is provided by
  <a href="http://nlisp.info/">NLISP</a> which might work well with
  GSLL.
